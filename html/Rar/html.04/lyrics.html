    <h1>Memories</h1>
    <p>Here's to the ones that we got
        Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
        'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
        Of everything we've been through
        Toast to the ones here today
        Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
        'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
        And the memories bring back, memories bring back you
        
        There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain
        When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the same
        Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
        'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, yeah
        
        Everybody hurts sometimes
        Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
        But everything gon' be alright
        Go and raise a glass and say, ayy

        When I felt all of the hatred was too powerful to stop (Ooh, yeah)

        <h1>Maps</h1>
        <p>I miss the taste of a sweeter life
            I miss the conversation
            I'm searching for a song tonight
            I'm changing all of the stations
            
            I like to think that we had it all
            We drew a map to a better place
            But on that road I took a fall
            Oh, baby, why did you run away?
            
            I was there for you
            In your darkest times
            I was there for you
            In your darkest nights
            
            But I wonder, where were you?
            When I was at my worst
            Down on my knees
            And you said you had my back
            So I wonder, where were you?
            When all the roads you took came back to me
            
            So I'm following the map that leads to you
            The map that leads to you
            Ain't nothing I can do
            The map that leads to you
            Following, following, following to you
            The map that leads to you
            Ain't nothing I can do
            The map that leads to you
            Following, following, following
            
            I hear your voice in my sleep at night
            Hard to resist temptation
            'Cause something strange has come over me
            And now I can't get over you
            No, I just can't get over you
            
            I was there for you
            In your darkest times
            I was there for you
            In your darkest nights
            
            But I wonder where were you?
            When I was at my worst
            Down on my knees
            And you said you had my back
            So I wonder where were you?
            When all the roads you took came back to me
